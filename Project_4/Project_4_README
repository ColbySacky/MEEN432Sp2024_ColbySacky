For my project so far. To run it I first run each EPA file, then I run the init and P4 init file. Finally, I run the Project_4_matcode_updated
which combines the P4_runsim and the Project 2 run code.
When you run it you will see that it runs but doesn't complete a lap (On the track visual plot at least). However, according to the script it completes 7 laps.
Furthermore, the SOC doesn't change and the break check fails.
I believe the issues are in the driver subsystem of the lateral model and/or the regeneration breaking in the acceleration controls section.
If that isn't the problem, it could also be that I may have connected my models wrong.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!
