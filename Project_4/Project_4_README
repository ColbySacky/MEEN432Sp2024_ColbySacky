For my project so far. In order to run it I first run each EPA file, then I run the init and P4 init file. Finally, I run the Project_4_matcode_updated
which combines the P4_runsim and the Project 2 run code.
When you run it you will see that it runs but doesn't stay on track. Also, the SOC doesn't change and the break check fails.
I believe the issues are in the driver subsystem of the lateral model and the regeneration breaking in the acceleration controls section.
If that isn't the problem, it could also be that I may have connected my models wrong.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!
