For my project so far. To run it I first run each EPA file, then I run the init and P4 init file. Finally, I run the P4_new_matcode which combines the P4_runsim and the Project 2 run code.
When you run it you will see that it runs and completes 7 laps. However, the SOC doesn't change and the break check fails.
I believe the issues are in the regenerative breaking in the acceleration controls section (Longitudinal model).
If that isn't the problem, it could also be that I may have connected my models wrong.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!

NOTE: IF YOU SEE THIS COME BACK IN AN HOUR, SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY CODE, IT was JUST WORKING!!!
